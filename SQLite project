## This is where I'm learning how to find specific dates/times in SQL

SELECT orderid, orderdate
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE orderdate between '02/13/19 00:00' AND '02/18/19 00:00';

SELECT location
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE orderdate = '02/18/19 01:35';

SELECT sum(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE orderdate like '02/18/19%';

SELECT orderdate from BIT_DB.FebSales;

SELECT distinct Product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE Product like '%Batteries%';

SELECT distinct Product, Price
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE Price like '%.99';

SELECT product, SUM(quantity)		<-- this is what I want to see in the table
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales			<-- This is the location of where I'm to find this 
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'	<-- This helps me find the location
GROUP by Product;			<-- This shows products, Sum of the quantity
