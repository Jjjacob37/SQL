#Using previous data, my goal here was to add a temporary table(CTE) 
in order to use it as a reference to complete a task
That task is, calculate the average popularity for the artists in the table. 
Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, 
you need to show their name, their average popularity, 
and label them as a “Top Star”;

WITH popularity_average_CTE AS (  <-- i created a temporary table and named it
SELECT s.artist_name,   
AVG(s.popularity) AS average_popularity <-- i'm selecting what i want to query which is name and the average popularity
FROM SpotifyData s  <-- i'm making this CTE from this table, and abbreviating it for this query
GROUP BY s.artist_name <--  Grouping it by artist name 
)
 
SELECT  artist_name,  <-- i have two columns that are from the CTE and creating another column naming each Top Star
        average_popularity,
        'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE   <-- This is where i'm grabbing this query data from
WHERE average_popularity>=90; <-- how i want to limit my query results
